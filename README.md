Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected to live. In mathematical terms, life expectancy refers to the expected number of years remaining for an individual at any given age. The life expectancy for a particular person or population group depends on several variables such as their lifestyle, access to healthcare, diet, economic status and the relevant mortality and morbidity data. However, as life expectancy is calculated based on averages, a person may live for many years more or less than expected. 

In order to predict life expectancy rate of a given country, we will be using Machine Learning algorithms to draw inferences from the given dataset and give an output. For better usability by the customer, we are also going to be creating a UI for the user to interact with using Node-Red.
